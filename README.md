# ImpulseResponseRoomModel
Impulse response of room LL101 Cooper Union for spacial characterization
Loudness, location, duration of chirp were the input parameters
Use CATT acoustics to model room reflections
Input anechoic recordings filtered through IR to see how recordings would sound in the room
Future work to input stereo using virtual acoustics
